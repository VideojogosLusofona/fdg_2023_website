# Foundations of Digital Games 2023

## &#11153; 12&#8211;14 April 2023, Lisbon, Portugal &#11152;

The 18th Foundations of Digital Games (FDG) held in Lisbon, Portugal, invites all research contributions in the form of papers, posters, demos, doctoral consortium applications, as well as panels, competitions, and workshop proposals.

We invite contributions from within and across any discipline committed to advancing knowledge on the foundations of games: **computer science**, **engineering**, **mathematics**, **natural sciences**, **humanities**, **social sciences**, **arts**, and **design**.  ​FDG invites authors to submit short or full papers reporting new research. Both short and full papers need to be anonymized and submitted in the ACM SIGCONF version of the [ACM Primary Template] to a paper track. All contributions should be submitted to [EasyChair].

FDG 2023 is held in cooperation with [ACM] and [ACM SIG AI], [SIGGRAPH] and
[SIGCHI]. Accepted papers will be published through the ACM International
Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS), unless stated otherwise (see
[track](tracks.md) information).
