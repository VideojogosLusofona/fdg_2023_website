The university can easily accommodate a multi-track conference where several rooms will be made available for the attendees. The university is home to its own movie theater, which is often used for large keynote presentations and can sit 130 people. The room also includes readily available resources to easily stream presentations over the internet. Furthermore, the university already accommodates all the hardware and human resources necessary for streaming talks, keynotes, and workshops online for all our participants due to the extensive film course existing at the university.

The workshops and conference will take place in two diverging buildings at Lusófona University, but within minutes of each other.
More specifically, the **workshops** will take place at [Biblioteca Vitor de Sá](https://goo.gl/maps/8QbwXLwMi63SzKoG9), and the
**conference itself** will take place at the [Lusófona University's main campus](https://goo.gl/maps/B4XA6SxohPdAhnDF8), as shown in
the following map:

Conference talks will take place at [Lusófona University's main campus](https://goo.gl/maps/B4XA6SxohPdAhnDF8) in Auditoriums 1 (Agostinho da Silva) and 2 (Fernando Lopes).
It is easy to get lost within the campus, so on conference days signs and directions will be set to facilitate navigation to the different locations, and volunteers will be
spread throughout the area to guide attendees. The campus map, highlighting the auditoriums, is shown below:

Entrecampos, Campo Pequeno, Saldanha or Marquês de Pombal (from closest to

these go straight to [Campo Grande station](https://goo.gl/maps/8MVp1ccuSCQhnPYC9).

## Conference Dinner

**1300 Taberna**

In 1846, one of Lisbon’s most significant factories, the weaving and textile
company Companhia de Fiação e Tecidos Lisbonense, found its home in Alcântara.
In the following years, the 23.000m2 industrial site was occupied by the food
processing company Companhia Industrial de Portugal e Colónias and by printers
Anuário Comercial de Portugal and Gráfica Mirandela.

After years of being hidden from the public eye, this little fraction of the
city has now been unveiled and returned to the community in the form of Lx
Factory. This creative hub is fuelled by companies and industry professionals,
but it has also been brought to life by an array of different events in fields
such as fashion, advertising, communication, multimedia, art, architecture and
music, among others, which have encouraged countless visitors to rediscover this
part of Alcântara.

**1300 Taberna** is one of the most popular restaurants in LX factory. 1300
Taberna is sprawling and stunning, with flamboyant lighting fixtures, fanciful
plates and cutlery and — most important — appealing food that puts Portuguese
staples through mildly inventive paces.

## Portugal and Lisbon

Portugal is in the Iberian Peninsula, bordering Spain and the Atlantic Ocean, and is the westernmost country in mainland Europe. Portugal is one of the oldest nations in Europe, tracing its history back to the 12th century when it officially became a country. Lisbon itself is a true melting pot of diversity and multicultural influences rooted in Roman and Celtic traditions, and shaped by its Moorish heritage, as well as its African and South American ties making it one of the most unique cities in Europe.

Portugal is also known for its great weather and beaches, where in the Spring and Summer temperatures can reach 35C (95F), making it a nice, comfortable location for an academic conference. Furthermore, Lisbon is close to a wide range of beaches, including Costa da Caparica and Carcavelos, a mere 20-minute drive from the conference venue, allowing attendees to take advantage of the nice weather.

Getting to Lisbon
Lisbon is a tourist-friendly city, with many flights arriving daily. From the US there are direct flights from Boston, San Francisco, New York, and Chicago, while Canada has direct flights from Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal. In Europe, most European cities have daily flights to Portugal, including cheap options such as Ryanair and Easyjet. Portugal also has its own national airline company (TAP), which connects South/North American, African, and Asian countries, while the Middle East is connected through popular airlines such as Turkish Airlines and Emirates.
