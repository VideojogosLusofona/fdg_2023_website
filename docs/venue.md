The university can easily accommodate a multi-track conference where several rooms will be made available for the attendees. The university is home to its own movie theater, which is often used for large keynote presentations and can sit 130 people. The room also includes readily available resources to easily stream presentations over the internet. Furthermore, the university already accommodates all the hardware and human resources necessary for streaming talks, keynotes, and workshops online for all our participants due to the extensive film course existing at the university.

## Portugal and Lisbon

Portugal is in the Iberian Peninsula, bordering Spain and the Atlantic Ocean, and is the westernmost country in mainland Europe. Portugal is one of the oldest nations in Europe, tracing its history back to the 12th century when it officially became a country. Lisbon itself is a true melting pot of diversity and multicultural influences rooted in Roman and Celtic traditions, and shaped by its Moorish heritage, as well as its African and South American ties making it one of the most unique cities in Europe.

Portugal is also known for its great weather and beaches, where in the Spring and Summer temperatures can reach 35C (95F), making it a nice, comfortable location for an academic conference. Furthermore, Lisbon is close to a wide range of beaches, including Costa da Caparica and Carcavelos, a mere 20-minute drive from the conference venue, allowing attendees to take advantage of the nice weather.

Getting to Lisbon
Lisbon is a tourist-friendly city, with many flights arriving daily. From the US there are direct flights from Boston, San Francisco, New York, and Chicago, while Canada has direct flights from Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal. In Europe, most European cities have daily flights to Portugal, including cheap options such as Ryanair and Easyjet. Portugal also has its own national airline company (TAP), which connects South/North American, African, and Asian countries, while the Middle East is connected through popular airlines such as Turkish Airlines and Emirates.

Lisbon has the advantage of having a very central airport, making it very easy for anyone arriving in Lisbon to easily get to their accommodations or anywhere around the city. Directly from the airport anyone can arrive at the conference venue in under 8 minutes by car (or Taxi) or take advantage of the extensive mass-transit system available, i.e., subway network available (Red and Green/Yellow line). Taxi services tend to run 24 hours a day and are quite affordable from the airport (≅ 10€ / 11$), while subway service runs from 6:30 AM to 1:00 AM every day.
