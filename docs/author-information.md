# Author information

The Foundations of Digital Games (FDG) 2023 is proud to invite contributions from within and across any discipline committed to advancing knowledge on the foundations of games: computer science and engineering, humanities and social sciences, arts and design, mathematics, and natural sciences. Papers and Demos will receive double-blind peer reviews. All other submissions will be single-blind. All papers are guaranteed at least three reviews. Games and Demos are guaranteed two reviews. There will be no rebuttal. ​All contributions should be submitted via [EasyChair].

## Workshop, Panel and Competition Proposals

FDG 2023 openly invites the community for the proposal of Workshops, Discussion
Panels and Competitions relevant to the digital game community. For more
information please refer to the [Tracks](tracks.md) section of the website.

## Submission Guidelines

All papers need to be submitted in the ACM SIGCONF version of the [ACM Primary Template]
within their respective track using [EasyChair]. When submitting, authors are requested to
select the track that fits more closely to their submitted work.

**Regular papers** should have a maximum of 10 pages, excluding references, reporting new
research. Regular papers should be anonymized, and accepted papers will be included in the
ACM proceedings.

**Late-breaking short papers** should have a maximum of 4 pages in the final double column
format, including references. Both single-column and double-column submissions are acceptable.
The ACM template has a double-column option (see interim Template) for both LaTeX and Word Documents
on the [ACM Website]. Note that single-column submissions can be slightly longer (e.g. a maximum of
6 pages), but extra work may be needed on acceptance to conform to page limits when converting to the
final double-column format. Late-breaking papers should be anonymized, and accepted papers will be
included in the ACM proceedings.

**Doctoral Consortium** papers should have a maximum of 8 pages in double-blind or single-blind
format, including references. Doctoral consortium papers should include the proposed research of
the Doctoral candidate, as well as a biographical note about the candidate’s background and work
so far. Doctoral consortium papers are NOT anonymized. DC papers will NOT be included in the ACM
proceedings.

**Games & Demos** submissions should include a 1-2 page description of the game and demo, as well
as a link on a video, screenshots, or executable of the submitted work. Games & Demos submissions
are not anonymized, so feel free to add your personal itch.io page, youtube channel, or other site
where the game is described. Games & Demos submissions will NOT be included in the ACM proceedings.

## Student Travel Grants

The conference is committing funds to help support the attendance of the
conference for 2023. The Travel Assistance Program has historically been
targeted in bringing students as well as some faculty members to FDG, who lack
strong travel funding support from their institutions. Around $15k (USD) are
being invested to support this initiative.

This support will be crucial in stimulating the community, offer opportunities
for graduate students willing to network and bring their papers to Lisbon, and
offer more opportunities for individuals to present their papers.

More information on the SASDG Grant can be found at on the 
[official website](http://sasdg.org/tap.html), while application forms can be 
done by following this [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSccak2zC98emiA9NyDnk9MISiK6vNtYesrngL_7M6cGbX6Nmw/formrestricted)

## Remote Options and Presentations

One of the core objectives of FDG 2023 is bringing back the in-person conference
model, providing the community with the means to network, discuss and present
their work directly with other community members.

However, the organization fully understands that not all members can physically
attend the conference and that traveling may simply be impossible. For this
reason, the conference will provide solutions for remote authors, with the
objective of maintaining exposure on their work and providing opportunities to
interact with the conference itself.

### Asynchronous Model

According to a lot of feedback received over the past hybrid conferences, FDG
2023 will offer a new approach to this type of conference model. The reasoning
for this switch is that previous experiences were not great for either online or
local attendance, due to the large costs required to guarantee a comfortable
experience for everyone.

Thus, for FDG 2023 the remote options will be handled as follows:

- Remote authors will have the opportunity to record their talk which will be
  live streamed at the event and provided for all remote/live attendants through
  asynchronous methods (hosted remotely and easily accessible).
- All sessions will be live streamed and recorded, guaranteeing quality image
  and audio for our remote community to attend the local talks. Q&A will still
  be provided through text-based applications (e.g., Discord).
- Local and remote attendance will have access to the FDG discord server,
  providing a way for both communities to communicate and discuss relevant work.

### Why are we doing this?

Opening two-way communication during a live event can significantly increase
costs, as we want to guarantee that sound quality, image and everyone is
comfortable during their presentations.

By offering an asynchronous model we provide everyone with the opportunity to
watch the talks they wish (when they want), while also guaranteeing a session
where they are presented live at the conference. Furthermore, we also guarantee
that through a broadcast method even remote attendees can get the most out of
the conference and have opportunities to interact with live speakers.

Finally, diverging time zones is also a big factor, which can make it impossible
even for remote attendees to attend talks “live”. Thus, this way attendees can
experience the conference when is most convenient.
